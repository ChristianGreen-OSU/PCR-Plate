# PCR-Plate
Pre Polymerase Chain Reaction Optimization
PCR is one of the leading research tools used today to understand gene expression. This code is an optimized PCR plate maker- provide the number of samples, 
the number of primers, the number of duplicates and the plate size and an optimized plate will be created. We are hoping to allow for user variation and internal
control features to be added in the coming weeks.
