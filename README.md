# PCR-Plate
Pre Polymerase Chain Reaction Optimization
PCR is one of the leading research tools used today to understand gene expression. This code is an optimized PCR plate maker: provide the number of samples, primers, duplicates and the plate size and an optimized plate will be created.

Feel free to add comments and ask questions in the lab to me directly.
